      <description>This is not a guide but only a collection of opinionated tips I can share to anyone visiting the island of Santorini.
ðŸš— Rent a car Renting a car is a must. The island is small but the public transportation is not very efficient. You can easily drive from one side of the island to the other in less than 30 minutes. We booked our car with Santorini Easy Rent. They have a wide range of cars and the prices are very competitive.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes Requests &amp; Limits</title>

      <description>This document is the result of research on the topic of CPU/Memory Limits and Requests for Kubernetes, to provide engineers with a better understanding of how such configuration work and can affect the execution and performance of services.
Requests and Limits are the mechanisms k8s uses to control the utilisation of resources such as CPU and memory.
Requests are what the container is guaranteed to get. If a container requests a resource, the kube-scheduler will only schedule it on a node that can give it that resource.</description>

      <title> Æ›ðŸ“¦ AWS Lambdas containers and Go</title>

      <description>TL;DR AWS official base images for lambdas ship entire distros, use scratch or distroless base images for statically compiled languages like Go and use the aws-lambda-runtime-interface-emulator as the entrypoint.
Intro In December 2020, AWS announced support for packaging and running lambdas in containers.
In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to dig a little bit deeper on how it works and how we can improve what&amp;rsquo;s described in the official article, so that we can run an example Go application as a Dockerised lambda both on AWS and locally in the most space efficient way.</description>
