*This is not a guide but only a collection of opinionated tips I can share to anyone visiting the island of Santorini.*

## üöó Rent a car

Renting a car is a must. The island is small but the public transportation is not very efficient. You can easily drive from one side of the island to the other in less than 30 minutes.
We booked our car with [Santorini Easy Rent](https://www.santorinieasyrent.com/). They have a wide range of cars and the prices are very competitive. The staff is very friendly and they can deliver the car to your hotel or the airport.

## üè® Where to stay

We stayed at [Avraki Hotel](https://www.avraki.com/). It's a small but cozy hotel in Kamari. Maria who runs the hotel is very friendly and she's been super helpful during our stay, most of my recommendations are her suggestions.
The hotel is very close to the beach and the main street of Kamari. The rooms are very clean and the breakfast is amazing.

### Kamari

Kamari is a small village on the east coast of the island. It's a very lively place with a lot of shops and restaurants. The beach is very long and the water is crystal clear. The village is close to the airport and the main road of the island which makes it a great place to stay, if you also consider that prices are lower than Oia and Fira.

***Tip for the beach***: rent a sunbed and an umbrella. The price is around 10‚Ç¨ for the whole day, but if you mention that you are going to have food as well, they will give you the sunbed and the umbrella for free.

I haven't got a favourite one, as they are all quite good and average priced: sea bream never disappoints me.

## üì∏ Places to visit

### Oia

Oia is the most famous village of Santorini. It's a must-see place. The sunset view is breathtaking. The village is very crowded during the day but it's worth a visit. The narrow streets are full of shops and restaurants. The view from the castle is amazing.

Parking is free but can be a problem, so I recommend to park the car in the parking lot at the entrance of the village and walk to the center. The walk is very pleasant and you can take some great pictures along the way.

### Fira

Fira is the capital of Santorini. It's a very lively place with a lot of shops and restaurants. The view from the cliff is stunning. The cable car is the best way to reach the old port. The ride is very short but the view is amazing.

### Emporio

Emporio is a small village in the south of the island. It's less crowded than Oia and Fira. It's famous for its venetian castle.

### Pyrgos

Pyrgos is a small village in the center of the island. It's less crowded than Oia and Fira. The view from the top of the hill is amazing. The village is very quiet and the streets are full of shops and restaurants.

### Akrotiri

In Akrotiri you can visit the light house on sunset, it's a great spot to take pictures but there are usually tourists around.

### Heart of Santorini

The heart of Santorini is a heart-shaped rock formation in the middle of the island. The view from the top is amazing. The place is very quiet and it's a great spot to take pictures.

## üõ•Ô∏è Things to do

### Katamaran tour

I highly recommend to book a katamaran tour. It's a great way to see the island from the sea and to swim in the hot springs. The tour usually includes a stop at the red beach and the white beach. The tour ends with a beautiful sunset view from the sea.

![Katamaran tour](https://res.cloudinary.com/indiependente/image/upload/v1722351806/indiependente.dev/santorini/IMG_3808_iudnw5.jpg)

This is the tour we booked via GetYourGuide: [Sunset tour](https://www.getyourguide.co.uk/santorini-l753/ocean-voyager-74-sunset-tour-t31512/).

### üç∑ Winery tour

Santorini is famous for its wine. There are many wineries on the island. I recommend to book a wine tasting tour. The tour usually includes a visit to the vineyards and a wine tasting session.

The winery we visited is [Venetsanos Winery](https://venetsanoswinery.com/). The view from the terrace is amazing.

## üêü Where to eat

I recommend to always call the restaurant instead of booking online, as websites are not always up to date.

Here are some restaurants we visited and we liked. They are all traditional greek restaurants and locals eat there as well.

General tips:

1. always ask for the catch of the day, it's usually very fresh and tasty
2. try the orange pie for dessert every time you get the chance

### The Cave of Nikolas (Akrotiri)

The restaurant is located in a cave. The view is amazing. The food is very good and the prices are average.

### Savvas Popeye (near Perivolos beach)

Fresh catch of the day presented and weighed right in front of you. Service is top-notch.

### Fratzeskos Tavern (Perissa)

Take away grilled octopus to eat on the beach.

### Galini Restaurant Tavern (Monolithos)

We got lucky and found some traditional dances.

### üêô Dimitris Ammoudi Taverna (Oia)

Book in advance, it's a very popular place. To reach the restaurant you have to walk down the stairs from Oia. The view is amazing.
So it's recommended to book a table on the day you plan to visit Oia.

Grilled octopus is a must try.
